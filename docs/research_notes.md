# Research Notes

Key findings and data used to inform the simulation parameters:
- **ATP Release & Kinetics:** Experimental studies detailing the kinetics and spatial profile of ATP release after neuronal injury.
- **Ectonucleotidase Activity:** Data on CD39/CD73 enzyme kinetics responsible for converting ATP to adenosine.
- **Microglial Receptor Kinetics:** Detailed characterization of P2Y12 receptor binding, internalization, and downstream signaling.
- **Region-Specific Extracellular Properties:** Measurements of diffusion coefficients, ECM structure, and local cell density for various brain regions (e.g., cortex, hippocampus).

These notes support the parameter settings in `assets/config.ini` and the design of intracellular and extracellular modules.
