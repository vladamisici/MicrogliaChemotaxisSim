# Design Overview

This document describes the architecture of MicrogliaChemotaxisSim. The simulation integrates:
- Reactionâ€“diffusion modeling for ATP and adenosine.
- Detailed microglial chemotaxis based on receptor kinetics (e.g., P2Y12) and intracellular signaling.
- Region-specific configurations to account for differences in extracellular matrix, diffusion rates, and cell density.
- Advanced numerical methods: Runge-Kutta integration with adaptive time-stepping and adaptive mesh refinement.
- Parallel computing utilities and visualization for real-time feedback.
