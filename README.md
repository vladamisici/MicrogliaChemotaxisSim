# MicrogliaChemotaxisSim

MicrogliaChemotaxisSim is a high-fidelity simulation of microglial chemotaxis in response to ATP release in a region-specific brain environment.

## Features
- Detailed reaction-diffusion solver for ATP (and adenosine).
- Advanced microglial behavior with receptor kinetics and intracellular signaling.
- Region-specific configuration (e.g., cortex, hippocampus) adjusting diffusion, ECM factors, etc.
- Adaptive mesh refinement and adaptive time-stepping.
- Parallel computing support.
- Real-time visualization with VTK/OpenGL.
